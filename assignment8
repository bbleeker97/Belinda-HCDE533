    For my final project I have made a prop for a cosplay of Lilith Clawthorne from The Owl House. 
    Following my intial plan I started with editing the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5206312"> .stl file I got from Thingiverse. </a>
    I started with the eyes. First I hollowed out the .stl where the eyes were by creating a curve around the socket, extruding the curve, extending it with "Scale1D"
    and then using "MeshBooleanDifference" to cut it away.
    </p>
    <p>

    <img src="A8Eyes2.png" width=500></a>
    </p>
    <p>
    The next step was to create the eye itself. I used a section from the piece I used to cut the mesh. I used the "CageEdit" tool to edit the piece so it was curved.
    To select the specific piece I used the "Bounding Box" option. From there I edited points until the solid was shaped as I liked.
    Next, I used the "Mirror" tool to create a new piece for the other side.
    Lastly, I created a box to go around the eye pieces I would use to create a mold.

    <img src="A8Eyes6.png" width=500></a>
    </p>  
    <p>
      I then reprinted the piece and it worked perfectly!
      I also tested it with the pieces I had laser cut last week.

    </p>  
    <p>
I used the objects I had created in the previous assignment to create a base.
      The base had the same shape for the plug in the center. 
      I used the previous objects that represent the parts I would laser cut to create hole for them to press fit into.
      Lastly I used a cylinder to make a channel at the bottom for the cord.
    <p>

    <img src="A6Base1.3.png" width=500></a>
    <img src="A6Fix1.3.png" width=500></a>
    </p>  
    <p>
I then sent the .Stl to the 3D printer, where we encountered issues. 
      The bottom appeared to be sticking when I started it but overnight somehow it didn't stay that way.
      The print was warped, so I ran it again this time using the gluestick trick.
      While the second one was printing I foolishly decided to test if the laser cut pieces fit in the base, the slots were warped because of the misprint
      so, when I tried to take the pieces out they broke.
    <p>    
    <img src="A6FailPrint1.jpg" width=500></a>

    <img src="A6FailPrint3.jpg" width=300></a>
    </p>   
    <p>
    So while the base continued to print I went to campus to recut my pieces. 
    I made some minor edits to them thinking they would fit together, I ended up not using them because I had some personal emergencies.
    Because of these emergencies I had to scrap my plans for the shade, but I used two methods, the blub can be removed, and they are pressfit, so it should fulfill the assignment.
    When I got to the 8 I learned that they had set up the new laser cutter and that it was the only one I could use.
    I failed the first print because it wouldn't get through when the staff explained that with these the power, speed, and PPI are determined by the material selected.
    Instead I changed the vector cutting setting to increase the cutting power.
    In the end I used: Power 100%, Speed 6%, PPI 300, Z-Axis 2.5, Vector Cutting +15%. The final cut took 2 mintues and 47 seconds.
    I then tested the main parts, the ones that hold the bulb, and the fit was more precise than the other ones, which was great.

    <p>
    Finally the base print was finished it took 15 hours 3 minutes and 4 seconds to print, and it came out correctly.

    Here is the final product. I didn't have enough time to make the part of the molding assignment and a shade, 
      because of outside incidents, hopefully this counts well enough.

    For the molding part of this assignment I started trying to make my own .stl while the 3D print was finishing as a test.
    In the end Junchao pointed out it was better for a 1-piece mold and time didn't allow for it.
    So, it was scrapped but I absolutely loved the outcome so I kept it in the document.
    Instead I moved to using an .Stl from thingiverse <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5194763"> of Owlbert from the Owl House </a>
    I first split owlbert into two pieces by using "MeshBooleanSplit" and a surface along the middlepoint I found with "DraftAngleAnalysis".
    Next I made two rectangles larger than owlbert and used "BooleanDifference" to create spaces for a pouring channel and air tube.
    I then used 4 rectangles to create the keys. And I used "MeshBooleanUnion" to make each side it's own .Stl.
    I then realized oh no, taking it away from the 3D model does the opposite of what I want so I had to restart.
    </p>

    <img src="A6Owlbert1.4.png" width="500">
    </p>
    <p>
    I repeated all of the above steps except instead of subtracting I added the pour tube and air tube.
    Next I created a hollow box around the mesh to create a box to pour the scilicone into.
    The initial print was extimated to be 15 hours so I followed Noelle's suggestion and messed with the settings in Cura.
    I changed: Layer Height -> .4, Wall Thickness ->, .45 and Infill Density to 10.
    This changed the time to 6 hours.

    Here we ran into issues, once again my 3D printer was printing with one side too thin and then with breaks in it.
    I have constantly had to re-level the bed, take out filament to cut off parts with indents.
    So my s/o took a full look and apparently one of the wire protectors was making it so the back left was unable to properly level.
    He ended up taking it apart, fixing it and then re-leveling it for me. Which I seriously need to thank him for, it wasn't easy.
    Here are examples of failed prints with the issues this caused.

    </p>
    <p>
    In the end the Owlbert prints took 5 hours 42 minutes and 41 seconds while the boxes to go around it took 4 hours 59 minutes and 4 seconds.
    Here is the final result.
