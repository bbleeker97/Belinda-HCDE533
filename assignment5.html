     For this project my first step was to create two .Stl files. 
      I cosplay so I thought I would work on a necklace piece for one of my upcoming projects. For my reference I used <a href= "https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/4a8dd0c7-e572-41ec-b046-cdfbf9a02312/dd04jos-776ed135-28cf-43ad-98bd-099884824d56.png/v1/fill/w_1024,h_1055,strp/sunset_shimmer_s_necklace_by_curvesandlines_dd04jos-fullview.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MTA1NSIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzRhOGRkMGM3LWU1NzItNDFlYy1iMDQ2LWNkZmJmOWEwMjMxMlwvZGQwNGpvcy03NzZlZDEzNS0yOGNmLTQzYWQtOThiZC0wOTk4ODQ4MjRkNTYucG5nIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTEwMjQifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.6XNpt4tI8XeL86LAI4Dy_zxTDlxPTEsmwP0KTA5_rvIhttps://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/4a8dd0c7-e572-41ec-b046-cdfbf9a02312/dd04jos-776ed135-28cf-43ad-98bd-099884824d56.png/v1/fill/w_1024,h_1055,strp/sunset_shimmer_s_necklace_by_curvesandlines_dd04jos-fullview.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MTA1NSIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzRhOGRkMGM3LWU1NzItNDFlYy1iMDQ2LWNkZmJmOWEwMjMxMlwvZGQwNGpvcy03NzZlZDEzNS0yOGNmLTQzYWQtOThiZC0wOTk4ODQ4MjRkNTYucG5nIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTEwMjQifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.6XNpt4tI8XeL86LAI4Dy_zxTDlxPTEsmwP0KTA5_rvI"> this image</a>.
      I created the pendant part by creating a curve of the outline and using "rotate" to make it a 3D shape. 
      I connected the top part by using the solid tools to shape it and used "booleanunion" to connect them.
      Next, I created a cylinder and used "booleandifference" to create a hole so a chain/rope could fit through.
      For the sun .Stl I put the image into Rhino, used "scale" to match it to the pendant.stl size. Then I moved the pendant shape.
      I traced the sun pattern and made it a solid with "extrudecrv". For the middle I created a sphere for the middle, using "booleandifference" to make it only appear on the top.
      Lastly I exported both solids separately as their own .Stl files and then imported them into the same file.

    </p>
    <p>
   I ended up using "quadremesh" twice on the pendant because the edges were too rigid in the first mesh. 
   From right to left we have Quadremesh with 1,000, Quadresmesh wit 2,000, and the original mesh.

    </p>  
    <p>
   I tried using "quadremesh" on the sun.stl but it took away the smoothness of the original mesh, so I stuck with the original.
   From right to left we have Quadremesh with 1,000 and the original mesh.

    </p>  
    <p>
     Lastly I combined the two meshes to create a single mesh. In the end I used the "join" command as "booleanunion" couldn't mesh the objects together.
    <p>

    I then imported the combined mesh into Cura to test that everything turned out alright. Which it did!

    <p>
    Lastly, I 3D printed my mesh, the first one came out wonky because the filament got tangled at the end. But the second one came out perfectly!

    For the lamp part of this assignment, I did most of the wireframing and plan to laser cut the wood pieces before class.
    First, I created a holder for the bulb, with the measurements of the bulb I took. 
    Next I create stands (the first version is what I ended up using, I changed it a lot though). The first step was measuring the wood I have at 2.83mm thickness.
    Next I used curves to create two block like stands that would connect with each other, keeping them separate with different layers. 
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     I then created pressfit pieces to create the "skeleton" of the shade. These pieces put together should hold the lamp shade in place.
     For each of these I created the first one as a curve, extruded it, placed it on the model and used "polar array" to make sure it fit with the standing pieces.

    </p>
    <p>
     The last modeling I did was to create a base that the stands would connect to so the lamp doesn't fall over because it is top heavy.
      I created the base using "truncated cone" and used the stands with "boolean difference" to create slots for them to connect. 
      Then I created a cylinder to make a tube for the wire of the lamp to go through.

     I plan to cut out the wood parts before class so this may be updated if I finish that beforehand.
