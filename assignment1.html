            I started my assignment by looking for ideas online. I found <a href="http://aaminadesigns.co.za/?tag=press-fit"> this example </a> using flowers and connectors to make a model. I wanted to try a different flower shape, a Sakura blossom. I found <a href=https://freesvg.org/img/Anonymous_sakura.png> this image </a> and used Adobe Illustrator to turn it into an outline. I moved that outline to Rhino and used one of the line paths to outline the blossom. 
I then took measurements of the cardboard I decided to use to determine the width of the cutout points I would use to press-fit the pieces together. I then used the polar array to create an octagon with a cut-out section to be the connector piece.

I tested the model with the laser cutter at the 8 and it did not pass the shaker test.

I got some help from Junchao to shrink the cutouts for the press fit and it passed the shake test.

Lastly, I did a final run at the 8 with the following settings: 
Power: 100%, Speed:10%, PPI: 300, Z-Axis 0.165” Vector Performance: Quality, Throughout.
Material: General Soft Wood and Material Thickness: 0.165”
