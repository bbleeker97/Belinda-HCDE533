            I started my assignment by looking for ideas online. I found <a href="http://aaminadesigns.co.za/?tag=press-fit"> this example </a> using flowers and connectors to make a model. I wanted to try a different flower shape, a Sakura blossom. I found <a href=https://freesvg.org/img/Anonymous_sakura.png> this image </a> and used Adobe Illustrator to turn it into an outline. I moved that outline to Rhino and used one of the line paths to outline the blossom.

             Then I took measurements of the cardboard I decided to use to determine the width of the cutout points I would use to press-fit the pieces together.

        I then used the polar array in Rhino to create an hexitagon with a cut-out section to be the connector piece. 
        To complete this I first used one half of on of the petals I had outlined and mirrored it to make one petal. 
        This was done within a 3" circle, the edge of the petal should touch the outline of the circle.
        I polar arrayed this shape six times. Next, I made a rectangle the width of the cardboard, polar arrayed 6 times inbetween the petals.
        Next I used trim to cut out the connector sections and finally, joined all of the remaining curves together (except the circle).

        I made a second piece which I would use to be a connector. I made a circle and made a line at the the top of it and polar arrayed that 6 times.
        I used the same rectangle system to make the cut outs. 
        Lastly I trimmed the piece of the circle that went outside those lines before joining the curves together.

I tested the model with the laser cutter at The 8 and it did not pass the shaker test.

I got some help from Junchao to shrink the cutouts for the press fit and it passed the shake test.

Lastly, I did a final run at The 8 with the following settings: 
    </p>
    <p>
Power: 100%, Speed:10%, PPI: 300, Z-Axis 0.165” Vector Performance: Quality, Throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
Material: General Soft Wood and Material Thickness: 0.165”
    </p>

Here is the final shake test.
