     Part 1:
    </p>
    <p>
      First for this assignment I had to set-up my 3D-Printer. That took about an hour and 40 minutes. 
      I watched the tutorial video first and afterwords put it together, getting a baseline for everything first helped.
      Then I set out to actually put it together. 
      I got lucky my bed was secure, and the extruder didn't wiggle from the start.

    </p>
    <p>
    Once I finished assembling everything (pleasae ignore the mess), I moved it to a desk and checked every bolt was secure. 
      With that complete I did a little shake test (the desk was somewhat unstable), and it passed with flying colors.

     Part 2:
    </p>
    <p>
      Next was to level the bed. Oh boy, was this a pain. The back left skrew was initially jammed and I think I spent over an hour testing again and again until it was level.
      I was unable to get the bed to level with the glass top, for whatever reason it just didn't work so I leveled it with the magnetic bed.
      Here is the proof of my long and tedious work.

    I did do the test print but forgot to take a picture, sorry. Alas, now I could finally print!

    On to part 2, the cubes. I foolishly made my first file in CM, as the measurements were asked in CM. There I made a 2x2 square and extruded it by 2.
        Once I realized Cura worked in MM I changed the file units to MM so the cube was 20x20x20.

    </p>
    <p>
    <p>
With that finished I moved to Cura and created the Gcodes. The first step was to export the cube in MM to an .Stl file. Then use the Cura settings to print:
        one Low Quality, one Standard Quality, one Super Quality, and one Standard Quality with a concentric top and bottom (Thank you Andy Moon!).
        Below are the prints with the times and measurements on the sticky note attached.

Part 3:
    </p>
    <p>
 Now we have reached the tubes and cylinders. I started with the cylinders as I thought they would be easier to make. I created a 30MM (3CM) circle using the circle tool.
    Next I used the solid tool, "extrude closed planar curve" with an extrusion of 30. This created the base cylindar. Finishing this process I exported it as an .S0tl file.
    I had two versions, one exported with .1MM tolerance and one with .001MM tolerance.
    To make the tubes, I used the "tube" tool in solid tools. I initially tried to make two cylindars and cut one out of the other but my s/o showed me the tube function.
    I made the "tube" with a 15 radius and an inner radius of 14.6. This made the .4 one extrusion distance becasue my nozzel is .4MM which I double checked with the length function (line placed across the tube extrusion). (Thank you to Jesslord!).
    This tube was also exported as an .Stl file.
    Lastly, I took the two .Stl files and put them on Cura using the specific paramaters in the assignment.

        Tubes: 1 Single extrusion & 1 double extrusion with a random z-seam alignment. 
        Below are the prints with the times and measurements on the sticky note attached.

    <p>    
        Cylinders: .1MM tolerance, .001MM tolerance, spiralize outer contour mode, and printed on the side with supports 
        I did end up taking off the supports of the last cylindar to see how that worked before I measured it.
        Below are the prints with the times and measurements on the sticky note attached.

Part 4:

    Finally we reach my nested object. I got hyperfocused on one idea, and jumped with it. I wanted to make a korok acron in a log.
    I made the log using a tube and cylinder. I overlapped the cylinder so it would stick out, and angled it so it wasn't horizontal. 
    Next I used the trim tool to remove the parts of the cylinder that went inside the tube.
    For the acorn I had my s/o show me first. I then used solid tools to make a curved bottom shape, a smaller curved top and a cylinder at the top.
        I then used fillets to curve the pieces to the right shape.
    I made all of them solid and then joined them together.
    lastly I made a small cylinder that I placed within the tube and acron, I cut out the shape of the cylinder with "boolean difference".
    Lastly I moved the acron and cylinder so they would print inside the log-like tube.

    This is how they printed as a nested object (the final result)
