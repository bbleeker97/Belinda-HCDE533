     First for this assignment I had to set-up my 3D-Printer. That took about an hour and 40 minutes. 
      I watched the tutorial video first and afterwords put it together, getting a baseline for everything first helped.
      Then I set out to actually put it together. 
      I got lucky my bed was secure, and the extruder didn't wiggle from the start.

    Once I finished assembling everything (pleasae ignore the mess), I moved it to a desk and checked every bolt was secure. 
      With that complete I did a little shake test (the desk was somewhat unstable), and it passed with flying colors.

      Next was to level the bed. Oh boy, was this a pain. The back left skrew was initially jammed and I think I spent over an hour testing again and again until it was level.
      Here is the proof of my long and tedious work.

    I did do the test print but forgot to take a picture, sorry. Alas, now I could finally print!

    On to part 2, the cubes. I foolishly made my first file in CM, as the measurements were asked in CM. There I made a 2x2 square and extruded it by 2.
        Once I realized Cura worked in MM I changed the file units to MM so the cube was 20x20x20.

With that finished I moved to Cura and created the Gcodes. One Low Quality, one Standard Quality, one Super Quality, and one Standard Quality with a concentric top and bottom.
        Below are the prints with the times and measurements on the sticky note attached.

    <p>
Power: 20%, Speed: 15%, PPI: 300, Z-Axis 0.165” Vector Performance: Quality, Throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
Material: General Soft Wood and Material Thickness: 0.165”
    </p>
    <p>
Total time took about 7 and a half minutes.
