         After the first assignment I wanted to make an easier shape now that I had to use Grasshopper. I wanted to do an octogon which I made myself so it would have some curves to it.
        I was able to make  the shape by using a circle, a line, polar arrayed, and a rectangle polar arrayed.

    Unfortunately I couldn't cut the curves that went over the flat edge of the line because unlike Rhino, Grasshopper requires that objects be trimmed by a complete curve. 
        After trying multiple things I went to Junchao's office hours and we both tried going through it until we found a solution, making a circle around the section using the lines, to cut the curved edge away.

        Thankfully it worked! hours of trying to figure it out, messing with the code, trying to do it in Rhino and copy the commands over, and it was time to use the laser cutter.

    I used the same cardboard from the previous assignment and now that I knew the slots needed to be smaller I could adjust them for a better fit.

        The new .13" slots fit together perfectly and there was no movement even with excessive shaking.

Once the fit was secure, I did a final run at The 8 with the following settings: 
    </p>
    <p>
Power: 20%, Speed: 15%, PPI: 300, Z-Axis 0.165” Vector Performance: Quality, Throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
Material: General Soft Wood and Material Thickness: 0.165”
    </p>
    <p>
Total time took about 7 and a half minutes.

Here is the final shake test.
