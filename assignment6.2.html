   After printing my first 3D part of the mold I realized two things, 1. the box was way too big and 2. there was a ton of supports that the silicone would go through the hole at the bottom.
   Next step was to remake the model, but for whatever reason I didn't keep a copy of any of the previous steps. 
   So, in a new file I imported the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5194763"> file I got from thingiverse </a> again.
   Following the same steps as before I split the model, this time I created a cylinder to fill the hole, it took a lot of resizing so it would stay a closed mesh.

    </p>
    <p>
Next I remade the base, I realized that the air pocket I originally had wouldn't work and didn't need to be so big.
    I created a solid cone for the pouring, "booleanUnion"ed and then trimmed to fit as a half.
    I made two small cyliners and mirrored them to create small air pockets and used "booleanUnion" to combine it to the base.
    Next I used spheres instead of rectangles for the keys, I mirrored the first one and then the two to make all 4 even. 
    I created a copy of the based and placed it 180 degrees against the top of the original and used "booleandifference" to create the indents.
    After moving that part back to the bottom I used "booleanunion" on the other piece with the spheres.

    </p>  
    <p>
    I then placed the half of the mesh I imported and edited in the middle. 
    To make it even on the other side I used the "mirror" tool.
    To finalize the pieces I used "meshbooleanunion".
    Then I tested the model by creating negative space of each section in two cubes and moving them to fit together.
    This confirmed that the mold should create the shape I was looking for.
    </p>

    </p>  
    <p>
    I used the same box as before but added a lip underneath based on _'s advice to make the mold easier to push out.

    </p>  
    <p>
    I was able to place all four pieces in one cura file and sent it to the 3D printer where it took 10 hours 55minutes and 24 seconds to print overnight.

    Next I...

    Finally the base print was finished it took 15 hours 3 minutes and 4 seconds to print, and it came out correctly.

    Here is the final product. I didn't have enough time to make the part of the molding assignment and a shade, 
      because of outside incidents, hopefully this counts well enough.

    For the molding part of this assignment I started trying to make my own .stl while the 3D print was finishing as a test.
    In the end Junchao pointed out it was better for a 1-piece mold and time didn't allow for it.
    So, it was scrapped but I absolutely loved the outcome so I kept it in the document.
    Instead I moved to using an .Stl from thingiverse <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5194763"> of Owlbert from the Owl House </a>
    I first split owlbert into two pieces by using "MeshBooleanSplit" and a surface along the middlepoint I found with "DraftAngleAnalysis".
    Next I made two rectangles larger than owlbert and used "BooleanDifference" to create spaces for a pouring channel and air tube.
    I then used 4 rectangles to create the keys. And I used "MeshBooleanUnion" to make each side it's own .Stl.
    I then realized oh no, taking it away from the 3D model does the opposite of what I want so I had to restart.

    </p>
    <p>
    I repeated all of the above steps except instead of subtracting I added the pour tube and air tube.
    Next I created a hollow box around the mesh to create a box to pour the scilicone into.
    The initial print was extimated to be 15 hours so I followed Noelle's suggestion and messed with the settings in Cura.
    I changed: Layer Height -> .4, Wall Thickness ->, .45 and Infill Density to 10.
    This changed the time to 6 hours.

    Here we ran into issues, once again my 3D printer was printing with one side too thin and then with breaks in it.
    I have constantly had to re-level the bed, take out filament to cut off parts with indents.
    So my s/o took a full look and apparently one of the wire protectors was making it so the back left was unable to properly level.
    He ended up taking it apart, fixing it and then re-leveling it for me. Which I seriously need to thank him for, it wasn't easy.
    Here are examples of failed prints with the issues this caused.

    <p>
    In the end the Owlbert prints took 5 hours 42 minutes and 41 seconds while the boxes to go around it took 4 hours 59 minutes and 4 seconds.
    Here is the final result.
